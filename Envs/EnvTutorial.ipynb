    "### Environment Space Attributes\n",
    "    Most environments have two special attributes: action_space, observation_space\n",
    "\n",
    "    These contain instances of gym.spaces classes\n",
    "    Makes it easy to find out what are valid states and actions I\n",
    "    There is a convenient sample method to generate uniform random samples in the space.\n",
    "#### gym.spaces\n",
    "    Action spaces and State spaces are defined by instances of classes of the gym.spaces modules\n",
    "\n",
    "    Included types are:\n",
    "      gym.spaces.Discrete\n",
    "\n",
    "      gym.spaces.MultiDiscrete\n",
    "\n",
    "      gym.spaces.Box\n",
    "\n",
    "      gym.spaces.Tuple\n",
    "    All instances have a sample method which will sample random instances within the space\n",
    "#### gym.spaces.Discrete\n",
    "    The homework environments will use this type of space Specifies a space containing n discrete points\n",
    "    Each point is mapped to an integer from [0 ,n−1]\n",
    "    Discrete(10) A space containing 10 items mapped to integers in [0,9] sample will return integers such as 0, 3, and 9.\n",
    "#### gym.spaces.MultiDiscrete\n",
    "    You will use this to implement an environment in the homework\n",
    "    Species a space containing k dimensions each with a separate number of discrete points.\n",
    "    Each point in the space is represented by a vector of integers of length k\n",
    "    MultiDiscrete([(1, 3), (0, 5)]) A space with k= 2 dimensions First dimension has 4 points mapped to integers in [1,3] Second dimension has 6 points mapped to integers in [0,5] sample will return a vector such as [2,5] and [1,3]\n",
    "#### gym.spaces.Box\n",
    "    Used for multidimensional continuous spaces with bounds\n",
    "    You will see environments with these types of state and action spaces in future homeworks\n",
    "    Box(np.array((-1.0, -2.0)), np.array((1.0, 2.0))) A 2D continous state spaceI First dimension has values in range [−1.0,1.0) Second dimension has values in range [−2.0,2.0) sample will return a vector such as [−.55,2.] and [.768,−1.55]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating an Environment\n",
    "#### gym.Env Class\n",
    "    All environments should inherit from gym.Env\n",
    "    At a minimum you must override a handful of methods:\n",
    "    step()\n",
    "    reset()\n",
    "    At a minimum you must provide the following attributes action_space, observation_space\n",
    "#### Subclass Methods\n",
    "    _step is the same api as the step function used in the example\n",
    "    _reset is the same api as the reset function in the example\n",
    "    You may also provide the following methods for additionalfunctionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "    _render\n",
    "    _close\n",
    "    _configure\n",
    "    _seed\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attributes\n",
    "    observation_space represents the state space\n",
    "    action_space represents the action space\n",
    "    Both are instances of gym.spaces classes\n",
    "    You can also provide a reward_range , but this defaults to (−∞,∞)\n",
    "#### Registration\n",
    "    How do you get your environment to work with gym.make()? You must register it\n",
    "#### Registration Example\n",
    "    from gym.envs.registration import register\n",
    "\n",
    "    register(\n",
    "      id='Deterministic-4x4-FrozenLake-v0',\n",
    "      entry_point='gym.envs.toy_text.frozen_lake:FrozenLakeEnv',\n",
    "      kwargs={'map_name': '4x4',\n",
    "      'is_slippery': False})\n",
    "    id: the environment name used with gym.make\n",
    "    entry_point: module path and class name of environment\n",
    "    kwargs: dictionary of keyword arguments to environment constructor\n",
    "#### Discrete Environment Class\n",
    "    A subclass of the gym.Env which provides the followingattributes\n",
    "    nS: number of states\n",
    "    nA: number of actions\n",
    "    P: model of environment\n",
    "    isd: initial state distribution\n"
